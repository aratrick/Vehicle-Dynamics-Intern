# Vehicle-Dynamics-Intern

This was a 1month internship(online) in which I learned the basics of Vehicle Dynamics through Video lectures, Quizzes and Projects. I learned a lot of concepts and terminologies related to vehicle dynamics. I learned about the Suspension system, Steering Mechanism and Geometry, Chassis and Structures, Design factors and Considerations, Manual and Automatic Transmission Theory and the Braking System. Overall it was a nice experience.
